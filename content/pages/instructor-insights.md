## Instructor Insights

Below, Professor Yufei Zhao describes various aspects of how he taught _18.218_ _Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics_.

**OCW**: You structured problem sets a little differently in this course, providing students with a single file with many problems but only requiring a subset of these problems to be turned in for assessment. Tell us about your decision to structure problem sets this way.

**Yufei Zhao:** I wanted to give the students lots of opportunities to practice the techniques taught in lectures. The single-file format made it easier to add new problems to the list as the semester progressed, and in a way that was synchronized with the pace of the lectures. I only required the students to turn in a subset of the problems in order to ease the workload burden.

**OCW**: How did you use the lecture time in class to ensure maximum benefit to your students?

**Yufei Zhao:** The goal of the course was to introduce students to the probabilistic method, which has many applications that are quite nice and short. The students appreciated seeing a lot of examples in class. Longer proofs tend to be less well suited to the lecture format as they’re harder to follow. I’ve found that the lectures that work best are ones filled with small and neat examples and applications illustrating the method being discussed.

## Curriculum Information

### Prerequisites

No specific classes are required, but the course presupposes mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student, with basic knowledge of combinatorics, graph theory, and probability.

### Requirements Satisfied

18.218 can be applied toward a doctorate degree in {{% resource_link "69b03115-105b-44cf-95af-d8b96d634283" "Pure or Applied Mathematics" %}}, but is not required.

### Offered

A course covering a different topic in combinatorics is offered every spring semester; this iteration of 18.218 was such a course, but in the future it will be offered regularly under its own course number every other fall semester. 

## Assessment

### Grade Breakdown

Grading for 18.218 was entirely based on problem sets. There are no exams.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

68 students

### Breakdown by Year

The class included a mixture of graduate students and undergraduates.

### Breakdown by Major

Students in the course came primarily from mathematics and computer science.

### Typical Student Background

Most students in the course had strong mathematical problem solving backgrounds; many of the undergraduates had experience participating in math competitions.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lecture

Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 25 sessions total.

### Out of Class

Outside of class, students spent most of their time solving problems from the five assigned problem sets.
