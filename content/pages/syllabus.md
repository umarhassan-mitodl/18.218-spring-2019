Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

No specific classes are required, but the course presupposes mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student, with basic knowledge of combinatorics, graph theory, and probability.

Course Description
------------------

This course is a graduate-level introduction to the probabilistic method, a fundamental and powerful technique in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The essence of the approach is to show that some combinatorial object exists and prove that a certain random construction works with positive probability. The course focuses on methodology as well as combinatorial applications.

Topics
------

*   Probabilistic method
*   Linearity of expectation
*   Alterations
